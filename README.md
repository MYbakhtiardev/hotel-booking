## Brief Explanation of Design Decisions

### 1. **User Interface Design**

**Bootstrap Integration**: Chose Bootstrap 5 for rapid UI development and responsive design. This provides:
- Pre-built components (cards, modals, forms)
- Responsive grid system
- Professional styling out of the box

**Card-Based Layout**: Implemented a clean card design for room display because:
- Cards provide clear visual separation between rooms
- Easy to scan and compare room information
- Works well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Standard pattern users expect for booking interfaces

**Filter-First Approach**: Placed filters at the top of the page as users typically want to narrow down options before browsing, improving user experience and reducing cognitive load.

### 2. **User Experience Decisions**

**Modal for Booking**: Used a modal dialog for booking forms to:
- Keep users in context without navigation
- Reduce page clutter
- Provide focused interaction for form completion

**Toast Notifications**: Implemented toast notifications for user feedback at right top because:
- Non-intrusive way to confirm actions
- Automatically dismiss to avoid UI clutter
- Standard pattern for modern web applications

**Loading States**: Added loading spinners and states to provide visual feedback during data operations, improving perceived performance.
